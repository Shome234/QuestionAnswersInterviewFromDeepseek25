## 1. MVC Architecture

1. **What is MVC?**
   - **Answer**: MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that separates an application into three components: **Model** (data), **View** (UI), and **Controller** (logic).

2. **What are the advantages of using MVC?**
   - **Answer**: Separation of concerns, testability, scalability, and better organization of code.

3. **What is the role of the Model in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: The Model represents the application's data and business logic.

4. **What is the role of the View in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user.

5. **What is the role of the Controller in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: The Controller handles user input, processes requests, and interacts with the Model and View.

6. **What is the difference between MVC and Web Forms?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **MVC**: Uses a separation of concerns, supports testability, and is stateless.
     - **Web Forms**: Uses an event-driven model, has a stateful UI, and is less testable.

7. **What is Razor in .NET Core MVC?**
   - **Answer**: Razor is a markup syntax for embedding server-side code into HTML.

8. **What is the difference between Razor and ASPX?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Razor**: Lightweight, uses `@` for server-side code, and is more readable.
     - **ASPX**: Uses `<% %>` for server-side code and is more verbose.

9. **What is the ViewBag in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: ViewBag is a dynamic property used to pass data from a controller to a view.
