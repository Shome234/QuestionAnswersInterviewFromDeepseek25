---

### *1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)*
1. *What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?*
   - *Answer*: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

2. *Why is SRP important?*
   - *Answer*: It improves code readability, maintainability, and testability by ensuring classes are focused and cohesive.

3. *What is a "responsibility" in SRP?*
   - *Answer*: A responsibility is a single functional requirement or a reason for a class to change.

4. *How do you identify if a class violates SRP?*
   - *Answer*: If a class has multiple reasons to change or performs more than one task, it violates SRP.

5. *What is the difference between SRP and cohesion?*
   - *Answer*: 
     - *SRP*: A class should have only one responsibility.
     - *Cohesion*: A class should have highly related functionality.

6. *What are the benefits of following SRP?*
   - *Answer*: Easier debugging, better code organization, and reduced risk of side effects.

7. *What is an example of SRP in practice?*
   - *Answer*: Separating a User class into User (data) and UserRepository (data access).

8. *What is the downside of not following SRP?*
   - *Answer*: Classes become tightly coupled, harder to maintain, and more prone to bugs.

9. *How does SRP relate to the concept of modularity?*
   - *Answer*: SRP promotes modularity by breaking down functionality into smaller, focused modules.

10. *Can a class have multiple methods and still follow SRP?*
    - *Answer*: Yes, as long as all methods are related to a single responsibility.

### *2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)*
11. *What is the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)?*
    - *Answer*: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

12. *What does "open for extension" mean?*
    - *Answer*: The behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

13. *What does "closed for modification" mean?*

    - *Answer*: It reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding new features.

15. *How do you achieve OCP in practice?*
    - *Answer*: Use abstraction (e.g., interfaces, abstract classes) and inheritance or composition.
